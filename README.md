# virtual-computer-from-scratch

This is a project that is associated with "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)" in coursera.
<br>All the softwares and files used in this project are on the https://www.nand2tetris.org/ website.
<br>For building the virtual hardware I have used the simple Hardware Description Language (HDL) build for the course.
<br>All the steps followed in this project are given below.

1. Build the all common logic gates by using only NAND logic gate (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DEMUX, 16 BIT NOT, 16 BIT AND, 16 BIT OR, 8-WAY OR, 16 BIT 4-WAY MUX, 16 BIT 8-WAY MUX, 4-WAY DEMUX, 8-WAY DEMUX)
2. Build the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) using built logic gates. (Building Half Adder, Full Adder, 16 Bit Adder, 16 Bit Incrementer, Then combine them to build the ALU.)
3. Build the computer's main memory unit - RAM (16 Bit Register, 8 * 16 bit Registers Chip, 64 * 16 bit Registers Chip, 512 * 16 bit Registers Chip, 4k * 16 bit Registers Chip, 16k * 16 bit Registers Chip and Program Counter(PC))
4. Low level Assembly Programming for the CPU
   * Building the simple multiplication Program using inputs stored in the RAM.
   * Reading keyboard input from keyboard input memory location and writing the screen memory map so, when a key is pressed the screen will become black and when it is released the screen will become white.
5. Designing the CPU and Memory, then combine the CPU, Memory and ROM for create the Computer chip.
