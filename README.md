# virtual-computer-from-scratch

This is a project that associated with "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)" in coursera.
<br>All the softwares and files used in this project are on the https://www.nand2tetris.org/ website.
<br>For buiding the virtual hardware I have used the simple Hardware Discription Language (HDL) build for the course.
<br>All the steps followed in this project is given bellow.

1. Build the all common logic gates by using only NAND logic gate (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DEMUX, 16 BIT NOT, 16 BIT AND, 16 BIT OR, 8-WAY OR, 16 BIT 4-WAY MUX, 16 BIT 8-WAY MUX, 4-WAY DEMUX, 8-WAY DEMUX)
2. Build the Arithmatic and Logic Unit (ALU) using built logic gates.
3. Build the computers main memory unit - RAM
4. Designing the computers instruction set
5. Low level Assembly Programming for the CPU
